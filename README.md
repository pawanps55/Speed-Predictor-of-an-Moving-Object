4. Working Principle and
 4.1 Working Principle
1. Hardware Setup:
 I.
 Hardware Architecture:
 The system typically consists of two IR (Infrared) sensors placed at a certain
 distance apart.
 II. An Arduino micro-controller is used to control the system and process the sensor
 data.
 III. An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) module is used to display the calculated speed.
 2. IR Sensor Operation:
 I.
 IR sensors are used to detect the presence of an object passing through their
 detection range.
 II. These sensors emit infrared light and detect the reflected light. When an object
 passes between the sensor and the emitter, it interrupts the infrared beam, causing
 the sensor to output a signal indicating the presence of the object.
 3. Detection Process:
 I.
 When an object passes through the first IR sensor, it triggers a timer to start.
 II. As the object moves and crosses the second IR sensor, it triggers the timer to stop.
 III. The Arduino measures the time taken for the object to travel between the two
 sensors.
 4. Speed Calculation:
 I.
 Using the known distance between the two sensors, the Arduino calculates the
 speed of the object using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time.
 II. The distance is predetermined and fixed based on the physical setup of the system.
 III. The time is measured by the Arduino based on the start and stop signals received
 from the IR sensors.

5. Display on LCD:
 I.
 The calculated speed value is displayed on the LCD module in a human-readable
 format, such as kilometers per hour (km/hr).
 II. The LCD provides real-time feedback of the speed of the passing object.
 6. Feedback and Monitoring:
 II.
 Depending on the application, the system may provide additional feedback, such as
 displaying warning messages or activating alarms if the detected speed exceeds a
 predefined threshold.
 The system continuously monitors the sensors and updates the displayed speed as
 new objects pass through the detection zone.
